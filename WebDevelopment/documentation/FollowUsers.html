	<h2>Follow/Unfollow users </h2>	
	<div>This is a very interested and complicated functionality available in this application. This feature lets users to
	follow any user that he wishes to follow. If a user say A follows another user named B, then A can see all the reviews
	and favorite products of B. 'A' can add favorite products from B's list to his own favorite's list without affecting
	B's list. A can also view the list of reviews written by B. Now B will appear in A's follows list and A will appear in
	B's followed by list. In the screenshot given below, user named 'visha' is following another user named 'vijay'. In
	'visha' profile users she follows will appear as given below :
	</div>
	
	<div class="linePadding">
	<img class ="docMenu" alt="Image currently unavailable" src="../images/documentation_images/doc-profileFollows.png">
	</div>
	
	Since this is a two-way relationship, A following B means B is followed by A. So in Vijay's profile, visha will appear
	in followed by list as given below.
	
	<div class="linePadding">
        <img class="docMenu" alt="Image currently unavailable" src="../images/documentation_images/doc-profileFollowedBy.png">
	</div>
	
	If a user wants to unfollow a user from his list, he can do that by clicking the 'Unfollow this user' link.
