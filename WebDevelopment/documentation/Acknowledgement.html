		It was an interesting and amazing experience developing this project as part of the web development course. It provided
		me with an excellent opportunity to work with lot of hot and new technologies. I express my sincere gratitude to Prof. 
		Jose Annunziato for his teaching and guidance throughout to finish my project as planned. I would also like to thank Prof.
		Rasala for his valuable support. I also thank the Best buy team for granting me access to their API. My thanks to my TA Sneha Vankireddy for 
		her continued feedbacks and suggestions on improving 
		the project.
