		the user has to login. Also the products can be sorted based on price(low to high & high to low) and name. The user can limit
		the number of records to be shown on the page by modifying 'Iems per page' value. By default items per page is 10. There is also
		pagination link available, which can be used to navigate to the next/prev page if the number of products returned is more than 10.
