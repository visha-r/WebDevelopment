	<h2> Future enhancements </h2>
	<div>
	I could successfully design the project in the way I wanted to, by including all the functionalities I planned to
	implement. I thoroughly enjoyed every phase of the development cycle. I continuously re-engineered my project
	through feedbacks and comments from different users. I am planning to continue working on this project by adding
	the following functionalities :
	</div>
	<ol>
	<li> Enabling users to chat by sending messages to each other </li>
	<li> Adding magnifier for images in product details page </li>
	<li> Adding dummy payment system </li>
	</ol>
	<div>
	The features included as part of this project have been designed carefully, so the user can have a really good and fairly
	easy shopping experience!!
