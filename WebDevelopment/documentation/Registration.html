		valid username when user tries to register. If the username which the user is trying to choose has already been taken
		by some other user, error will be thrown. Also error will be thrown if the passwords entered don't match with each other.
		In short the following are the different errors thrown o this page for invalid data :
		<ol>
		<li> First name is left empty</li>
		<li> Email is left empty or entered email address is not of the form example@domain.com</li>
		<li> Username is empty or username is already taken by someother user </li>
		<li> Password is empty or passwords entered don't match each other</li>
