<h3>Week3 - Ajax and AngularJS</h3>
<p>
    The long awaited experiments finally!!! Ajax and AngularJS. This week I officially started my final project through
    the experiments. I spent few days reasearching on the public api to use for the project. Finally I landed up at
    Bestbuy api which I found to have a huge database of product information. I tried all my experiments with this api
    using angularJS ajax requests. My experiments for this week are the following :
    <div> 1. Movie Search Engine using simple ajax call</div>
    <div> 2. AngularJS ajax request fetching data from a remote server</div>
    <div> 3. Autosearch using angularJS data binding property</div>
    <div> 4. AngularJS Pagination</div>
    <div> 5. Adding dynamic contents</div>
</p>
<p>
    First I wanted to check my understanding on ajax by trying a simple experiment on movie database. I used basic ajax request to fetch
    the list of movies I need. Yeah it worked good!!! Then I tried something more relevant in a different database. But this time it's
    using AngularJS ajax call. This experiment is finally going to be part of my project as every online shopping will have a product
    search tool. Then I refined it further by doing autosearch as my next experiment. So as and when the user types something in the
    search bar, the search engine will keep populating the results. It was very cool! 
</p>
<p>
    In my previous experiments, all those results that were returned appeared on the same page thereby making scrolling very tough.
    Then I thought I should add pagination, so the results will be spread across multiple pages providing links to navigate. It made
    the result pages look much better!! 
</p>
<p>
    Products listing is here. What's next? Adding comments! The users should be able to view and add their own comments. So my last
    experiment was about adding reviews dynamically. At this point the newly added reviews are stored locally. But in the forthcoming
    experiments, they will be added to the database for persistence.

    Altogether, it was a good start for my project, as all these experiments are finally going to sit in my project.
