<h3>Week 10 - Final week for project functionalities </h3>

<p>
    This week I am almost done with all the functionalities I aimed to include in my project. I am planning
    to focus more on the UI design in the forthcoming weeks. I did the following experiments this week :

    <b>Store Locator :</b> <br />
    As users will be more interested in exploring the stores nearby, this experiment aims at finding all stores nearby the given zipcode.
    As it is not always possible to get stores at the exact location, I am using a range of 10 miles radius. So stores available within 10
    miles radius of the given zipcode will be returned.
</p>

    <b>
        Editing cart information :
    </b>
    <br />
    This experiment is about editing the cart information such as the product count. Once the user decides to add a product, to the cart,
    he might want to increase/decrease the count before checking it out. Specifying the count to any number greater than 0, will update the
    count. If the count is 0, the product will be removed from the cart thinking that the user is no longer in interested in the product.
    The user can also explicitly delete the product from the list by clicking the delete button.

</p>

<p>
    <b>
        Handling duplicate items in cart :
    </b>
    <br />
    This experiment is about handling the count for duplicate items in the cart. The user will sometimes try to add a product, which is
    already in the cart. In that case, the already existing product count has to be increased by 1 instead of adding a new product to the
    cart. This will save the life of both the buyer as well as the seller. I have handled this case by checking if the product that the
    user tries to add to the cart is already existing. If it exists, I update the product count otherwise create a new product with count
    initialized to 1. Accordingly the product count in the menubar badge is updated. Also the totalprice is updated based on the newly
    updated count.

</p>

<p>
    <b>
        Changing user password using angular directive :
    </b> <br />
    Though this experiment appears to be simple, it is not so. Because when user tries to change his password, he must enter his
    old password for security. I have written an angular directive which checks if the old password entered matches the current one
    in the database. Based on the value returned from the database,the case will be handled. Also I have written directives to
    check if the new passwords re-entered match each other.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        Making Follow/Unfollow user link dynamic :
    </b> <br />
    This experiment is about about making the follow/unfollow user link dynamic, as showing the user 'Follow user' link
    for another user who this user is already following will lead to errors. Also it is not meaningful to show 'Follow user' link to a
    user, who is already followed by this user. The user can choose to unfollow a user either following this link
    in the user detail's page or the one under 'network' tab in profile page.
</p>

<p>
    This week gave me the satification that I have covered all the required functionalities of the project. Stay tuned for a better
    UI design next week!!!
