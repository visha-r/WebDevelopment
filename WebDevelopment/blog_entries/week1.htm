<h3>Week1 - HTML5</h3>
<p>
    This being my first week, I was quite excited about trying on new experiments on HTML5 and CSS. 
    I initially had some issues in installing Windows on my Mac. But then installed all necessary 
    softwares successfully. I wanted to try experiments on the new semantics and techniques of HTML5. 
    So I did experiments on  the following : 
    <div>1. iFrame</div>
    <div>2. datalist</div>
    <div>3. details video & audio elements</div>
    <div>4. Date picker</div>
    <div>5. Drag and drop</div>
</p>
<p>
    Out of all the semantics I found audio and video elements very useful and interesting as it makes embedding
     audio and video contents into an html document very easy. The date picker of HTML5 is also a very useful tag 
    and it is very similar to the one in jQuery. In addition to data and time pickers, HTML5 also supports week
    pickers which I found very first of its kind. The drag and drop which is new in HTML5 is pretty cool and it can
    be used in applications like online shopping where the user can actually drag the items and drop into the cart.
    So this week I really learnt all new cool features in HTML5!!!
