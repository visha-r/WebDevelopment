<h3>Week 11 - Finally done with the project!! </h3>

<p>
    I successfully completed the project this week. I implemented every functionality that I planned to add to the project.
    I also did a neat documentation sparing one page with detailed explanation for each functionality of the project. I also 
    made a youtube video of the project demo, so anyone who wants to use the project can understand the underlying features
    better.

    <b>No last hour rush!!!</b>

    I had enough time to work on my project. I also had more time to add some additional features like handling duplicate items in the 
    cart which was not part of my initial project plan. In short I thoroughly enjoyed every phase of my project development cycle. It was
    a good learning experience. I love my project so much that I still want to work on the project adding some more cool features. I have
    the following features as the future enhancements :
</p>

<ol>
    <li> Adding map for store locator </li>
    <li> Adding magnifiers for the images in product details page </li>
    <li> Adding dummy payment system </li>
</ol>
