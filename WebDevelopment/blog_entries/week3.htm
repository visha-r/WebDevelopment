<h3>Week3 - Bootstrap & jQuery</h3>
<p>
    This week I had my hands on Bootstrap & jQuery!! I didn't know that designing a web page will be that easy using
    Bootstrap. I was really amazed at the styling features that Bootstrap offers for a flawless design. jQuery is equally good
    through its fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. So this week I explored many of the features in bootstrap
    & jQuery like:
    <div>1. Bootstrap elements - Grid-style, Badge, form-group, glyphicon, progressbar</div>
    <div>2. Bootstrap Experiment 2 - Bootstrap Table, Menu, Jumbotron & Pagination</div>
    <div>3. Bootstrap Experiment 3 - Carousel & JS collapse</div>
    <div>4. jQuery elements - hide, show, fade, animate, css</div>
    <div>5. jQuery UI elements - datepicker, tabs, autocomplete, slider & dialog</div>
</p>

    Instead of doing a very usual experiment by putting all bootstrap elements together explaining each, I wanted to give an innovative try.
    So I tried to reproduce windows MyComputer screen using basic bootstrap elements. I should say that this is one of my favourite experiments.
    This experiment covered some of the basic features of bootstrap. My next experiment focused on creating main menu and a table inside a jumbotron using bootstrap classes
    along with pagination. The final experiment on bootstrap uses carousel & JS collapse. I have been looking for an option to create slideshow
    of images on the homepage of my project. Bootsrap carousel comes to resue!!! I also liked the JS collapse that I am planning to
    include in my experiments link page.

    My first experiment on jQuery was on basic jQuery methods like hide, show, fade, animate & css. I found handling UI events on the fly very
    easy using jQuery. Next experiment was on jQuery UI elements like datepicker, tabs, autocomplete, slider & dialog. I just wanted to showcase
    my understanding on these elements by creating a form containing the same.

    In nutshell, this week I learnt two powerful frameworks used for UI design!!
