		<i> <b> Hi!!! Thanks for visiting my page!! I am Vishalakshy
				Rajaram Chettiar. People who know me call me Visha. I am a Computer
				Science graduate student at Northeastern University. I created this
				web page as part of my web development course CS5610. Having worked
				as a Software developer for more than 2 years, I have yearning
				interest towards learning new technologies. I am very excited about
				this course as I am going to experiment with lots of cutting-edge
				technologies like AngularJS, Node.js, MongoDB, CSS3, HTML5, jQuery
				etc.... I sincerely thank my Professor Jose Annunziato and the TA
				for their dedicated guidance throughout the course. </b>
