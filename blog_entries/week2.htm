<h3>Week2 - CSS</h3>
<p>
    This week my experiments were on CSS!! Yes the very same CSS that helps in styling HTML elemnts.
    CSS adds complement to the HTML documents by making them more presentable. I have already
    used CSS in many of my projects but only for basic styling. I never had a chance to use its advanced features like Responsive design,
    animation, zooming and flipping. So this week I had my hands full with experiments on the following : 
    <div>1. Flipping animation</div>
    <div>2. Responsive table</div>
    <div>3. Zooming animation</div>
    <div>4. Page layout</div>
    <div>5. Button animation</div>
</p>
<p>
    Flipping animation as the name implies flips the images back and forth when mouse hovers them. I'm going to
    use this feature on my home page to flip my pics. Responsive design is a new feaure which is getting really popular 
    with the advent of new electronic devices of different size. No matter how large or small the device is, responsive web 
    design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. I really had a great experience
    creating a responsive web page with a table that gets resized automatically based on the device size.

    Zooming animation and page layout are other interesting experiments of this week. The final experiment of this week is
    on button animation. Hovering over the buttons will make then rotate through 360deg and get zoomed in. I did this experiment
    as I have been looking for some kind of animation for the links in my home page.

    Previously I used to download the css files and customize them for my needs. But now I have confidence that I can make
    any kind of visual effects on my own using CSS!!!
